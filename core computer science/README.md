# Learn Object Oriented Programming

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects, which can contain data and code: data in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and code in the form of procedures (often known as methods).

[Computer Science](https://youtu.be/m_MQYyJpIjg?si=vmlCmidKys-ToP-I) - This video reviews the fundamental concepts of Object Oriented Programming (OOP), namely: 

Abstraction, which means to simplify reality and focus only on the data and processes that are relevant to the application being built; Encapsulation meaning that data and the programs that manipulate those data are bound together and their complexity is hidden. Encapsulation is often achieved by means of class libraries (dynamic link libraries, or DLLs); Inheritance which allows a class to derive its methods and properties from another class. Inheritance might be used to define an extensive hierarchy of super classes and subclasses; Polymorphism meaning different subclasses of the same superclass, which therefore share the same interface, can implement those interfaces in their own ways.  Polymorphism is implemented when classes override the code of the methods they inherit. The video also reviews the relationship between objects, otherwise known as entities, and classes, which are the code used to create objects.

# Learn Data Structures and Algorithms

A data structure is a method of organizing data in a virtual system. Think of sequences of numbers, or tables of data: these are both well-defined data structures. An algorithm is a sequence of steps executed by a computer that takes an input and transforms it into a target output

# Learn Database Management Systems

[IBMtechnologies](https://youtu.be/hRulZhTtUTg?si=CK2t5ijEpKxRWHXH) -- learn about databases in 7 minutes.


DBMS is a general-purpose software designed to create and manage the database in an efficient manner. It allows users to define, create, maintain, and share the database among various users and applications. Users can construct their own databases using DBMS to satisfy their business requirements. In fact, databases are used everywhere and are vital components of e-commerce and other web-based applications.
With DBMS, redundancy (or duplication) of data can be controlled in contrast to the traditional file systems, there is security and consistency of data and many more advantages which will be discussed.
